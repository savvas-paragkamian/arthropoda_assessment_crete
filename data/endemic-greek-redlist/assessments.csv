<p></p>",This is an obligate saproxylic species. There is little information about the ecology of this species. It lives in deciduous forests.,"<p>



</p><p>The main overall threat is likely to be degradation or loss
of habitat quality, involving structural changes in the tree populations arising
from changing land use – affecting age structures and tree density.
Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging
can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a
result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often
exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of
beetle populations are also key factors. The decline of forest is a major threat to this species.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>There is little information

This species is assessed as Least Concern since, although it has a restricted geographic range (extent of occurrence (EOO) is&#160;2,150 km², area of occupancy (AOO) is&#160;<em>ca</em>&#160;200 km²), it is locally quite common, the population size is estimated to be large, and is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. However, livestock grazing and bushfires could pose a threat.

Its habitat is most probably similar to that of other species of <em>Poecilimon</em>&#160;found on islands across the Aegean Sea. They are early season&#160;species, allowing the nymphs to feed on the abundant herbal vegetation. The adults are found on small shrubs (<em>Cistus </em>spp.) or thorny bushes in which they hide. This species is found from sea level up to 900 m Asl.","This species is found in areas which are of no direct interest to humans except for grazing livestock. The most likely threats for&#160;this bush-cricket&#160;are posed by overgrazing by goats and sheep, and by bushfires.","This species is widespread across Kasos and Karpathos, and is found from sea level up to 900 m Asl. Its presence is described as quite common (Heller <em>et al. </em>2011). It is uncertain whether or not there are yearly fluctuations, how big these are and what causes them.

The larva has not been morphologically described but precise observations have been made about its biology (Berger 1987, Sláma and Slámová 1996). The larva lives in rotten heartwood inside living trees: in barkless scars on the trunk or at the base of dead branches. The larva feeds at the boundary of living and dead tissues with high moisture. It can go to different depths in the wood, sometimes up to 12 cm deep. The development takes three years. The pupation occurs behind 0.5 to 4 cm of very hard exterior wood of ancient wounds of the tree. Those features are shared by most other <em>Pedostrangalia </em>species. The fungus that causes the heartwood decay in the trees has not been identified yet. The adults are active on flowers of chestnut or umbellifers in the second half of June and in July.","The biology -&#160;especially the range of host trees, the types of situation,&#160;and the decay fungus -&#160;need to&#160;be investigated in order to determine the potential threats.

As a consequence, there is a continuing decline in the extent of the habitat. Moreover, the removal of the <em>Platanus</em> trees might occur suddenly because they are even-aged and in declining condition, and there is a risk of <span class=""st""><em>Ceratocystis platani </em>disease.

Its present known extent of occurrence (EOO; based on collection records dated 1990 and later) is smaller than 5,000 km². Currently, the species is known from only 18 localities spread over only 15 locations and is confined to upper courses of brooks with shady habitats and moderate current speed. The population is regarded as severely fragmented, and a future population and range decline is expected due to climate change and rapid habitat degradation due to water over exploitation. All lotic habitats in Crete are threatened given the present climate trend and the increased water demand and caption. Given these threats, the expected increase in fragmentation of the species' distribution, and the small EOO and area of occupancy (AOO), this species is assessed Endangered (EN). If increased fragmentation of the population is not confirmed by the announced updating project by the recently organised Cretan group, this species would be reassessed as Near Threatened (NT).","Jödicke (2005) mentions <em>Coenagrion intermedium</em> from both running and standing waters. The former is assuredly the most important habitat as running waters are more common on the island and findings in standing water have been just occasional in localities where a brook feed a lake. The species was found at brooks near the coast but also in inland stretches, particularly at headwaters surrounded by gallery forests. It is absent from brooks without gallery forests. The species has a preference for stretches of brooks with a slow current and larvae have been collected from between submerged tree roots.","<em>Coenagrion intermedium</em> has presumably declined as a result of rapid habitat destruction and degradation, human exploitation of water, water pollution, eutrophication and forest destruction. <em>Coenagrion intermedium</em> is threatened due to its restricted distribution and its few numbers of known localities (currently 18 places on 15 streams). The current Greek agricultural policy leads to the decrease of <em>C. intermedium</em> by allowing for and favouring the cultivation and irrigation of olive trees (even directly at springs), the change of water regime of streams and streamlets and the destruction of bank side vegetation. Climatic change will also have a negative impact on breeding sites in the future, but this is already exacerbated by the increased water demand for agriculture and urbanized areas.","According to Jödicke (2005), the species is widespread and common on Crete, but the habitat quality is declining and the natural fragmentation of the species is likely to increase as a consequence of climate change and increase of water demand (Boudot and Kalkman 2015).",Decreasing,"<em>Coenagrion intermedium</em> is endemic to Crete (Greece) (Battin 1989, 1993; Boudot <em>et al.</em> 2009). Most of its populations are isolated by high mountain systems and dry areas (Boudot and Kalkman 2015) and this natural fragmentation is likely to increase due to drying of some headwater stretches (climate change and increase of water demand). Due to the recent discovery of six new localities (within five locations), 18 localities (within 15 locations) have been inhabited by this species since 1990.
