The species is therefore assessed as Least Concern.","<em>Enallagma cyathigerum</em> commonly occurs at standing and slow-flowing waters (lakes, ponds, pools, marshes, peat bogs). The species is especially common at sites lacking of fish such as acid bogs or at sites where the vegetation provides shelter from fishes. The species can occur in slightly brackish waters. It is one of several species which commonly reproduces in the Baltic Sea itself.",There are no major threats to this species.,The species is common and widespread in its European range and only in the south populations are more scattered. The sizes of the populations are generally high. It can occur in very high densities in central and northern Europe.,Stable,"<em>Enallagma cyathigerum</em> is one of the most widespread damselflies in the world.

Older studies include North America within its range, but recent studies have shown that the North American populations belong to <em>E. annexum</em> (Stocks <em>et al</em>. 2005, Boudot and Kalkman, 2015). The species is widespread and common in the European part of its range occurring to the far north of Scandinavia. It becomes scarcer towards the Mediterranean being absent from many of the islands and being rare in the low and dry regions of Spain, Italy and Greece. Populations from the northernmost parts of Europe and from Siberia are more melanic than those from the temperate European regions but are not considered as a distinct subspecies (Kosterin and Zaika 2003, 2010). It is replaced by <em>E. circulatum</em> on the island of Sakhalin (Russia) and Japan (Stock <em>et al</em>. 2005). <em>Enallagma cyathigerum risi</em>  (sometimes considered a good species, but there is no consensus in this respect) occurs in large parts of Central Asia. It is unclear whether the populations of <em>Enallagma </em>from the West Caucasus area pertain to <em>E. c. cyathigerum</em> or to <em>E. c. risi.</em> Currently, it is considered as a subspecies (Kalkman <em>et al</em>. 2020), because they produce hybrids in the meeting and overlapping areas.<br/><br/>Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information shows the available locality data for this species.",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),There are no conservation measures needed.,Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Globally the species is assessed LC based on its wide distribution. However, it has a near disjunct distribution and is missing in the steppe and desert areas in Central Asia. It is declining in its European range, where its AOO has been reduced to about 2,100 km², and has been assessed as Vulnerable in Europe based on an estimated decline of over 30 % over ten years that might be over 30 % in the next ten years.

This species is commercially exploited throughout its range where it is estimated to have undergone a decline of between 30-50% over the last 27 years (three generation lengths). While the trends in Spanish and Croatian fisheries have remained stable for the last 10 years, catch per unit effort in Corsica and Sardinia (two of the largest fisheries) has declined by 25% in 15 years and 60% in 25 years respectively. While these trends only run up until the late 1990s/ early 2000s these trends are thought to be ongoing. Recent FAO data for the entire Mediterranean reports an increase in landings from 165 t to 404 t between 2000 and 2009, however this includes the landings of&#160;<em>P. mauritanicus</em>.<em>&#160;</em>Future research effort should focus on monitoring the catch per unit effort for this species separately from&#160;<em>P. mauritanicus</em>&#160;to improve the accuracy of future assessments.&#160;</p><em></em>",<p>This species lives on rocky and coralligenous habitats from the coast down to 200 m of depth (Ceccaldi and Latrouite 1994) although in the Mediterranean it has been recorded down to 260 m (R. Goñi pers. comm.)</p>,<p>Over-exploitation by fisheries is a major threat to this species.</p>,"<p><em>Palinurus elephas</em> has been heavily harvested throughout its range and is generally considered to be overexploited, although long-term catch per unit effort (CPUE) data are not available for most fisheries (Goñi and Latrouite 2005). Traditionally, <em>P. elephas</em> was captured by means of baited traps until the development of new materials and hauling techniques in the 1960s led to the introduction of trammel-nets, which virtually eliminated trap fishing (Goñi <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>  <p>In the Atlantic, catch rates from the Welsh fishery showed a decline of 92% between 1980 and 1997 (Hunter 1999). A sevenfold decline in CPUE was registered in the SW Irish fishery between 1972 and 1999 (Tully 2011). In the Mediterranean, CPUE in the Corsican fishery declined by 25% between 1984 and 1999, associated with a 38% increase in effort (fewer boats but more nets fished) (Ruitort 1999). In NW Sardinia, CPUE declined by 70% between 1976 and 2001, along with a 60% increase in the number of boats. Catch rates of two Spanish Mediterranean fisheries have remained stable during the last decade at levels about eight times lower than in a population protected in a MPA (Groeneveld <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Official landing statistics of 2009 from the FAO Global Capture Production summary (FAO 2009) for Atlantic fisheries of <em>P. elephas</em> and <em>P. mauritanicus</em> combined, show a dramatic decline from 900 t in 1966 to 56 t in 2009. For the Mediterranean, the two species are reported separately. Landings of <em>P. elephas</em> peaked in the 1960s and 1970s at near 1000 t, declined to 165 t in 2000, and increased to 404 t in 2009. Unfortunately, irregular reporting by most countries, and the mistaken inclusion of <em>Palinurus mauritanicus</em> or other species (e.g. <em>Homarus gammarus</em> in Greece or <em>Panulirus regius</em> in Morocco) in some records, renders the data useless (Goñi and Latrouite 2005). Also, in fisheries where <em>P. elephas</em> is sold locally (e.g. southern Europe and Mediterranean) a potentially significant proportion of the catch may go unrecorded. A recent reconstruction of Corsican landings (1950–2008) suggested that 16 times more lobster were landed than are reflected in the data reported to the FAO (Harper and Zeller 2011). Nevertheless, a decline from 300 t in 1954 to 80 t in 2008 was still apparent.</p>  <p>A recent assessment of the Balearic, Corsican and Sardinian fisheries (LANCONNECT project; http://www.ba.ieo.es/lanconnect/) showed that fleets of 170–220 boats target <em>P. elephas</em> in each region with trammel nets during the 5 to 8-month fishing season. The estimated landings of each of these fisheries in 2009 ranged between 60 and 100 t, amounting to a total of 280–300 t, or 70% of the official FAO landings (404 t) for the entire Mediterranean in 2009. Tunisia has a reliable series of landing statistics because nearly all catches of <em>P. elephas</em> are exported for foreign consumption. Annual landings between 1990 and 2002 peaked at 74 t in 1993 and declined gradually to 33 t in 2002 (Quetglas <em>et al</em>. 2004), representing a decline of 44% in nine years.&#160; In Croatia reported annual landings were highest in 1953 and declined to 23-43 tons between 1985 – 1998, remaining stable the following decade (A. Soldo pers. comm. in Goñi and Latrouite 2005).</p>  <p>French Atlantic fisheries landed up to 1000 t in the 1950s, but only 25 t in 2010 (Laurans <em>et al</em>. 2011). Presently, <em>P. elephas</em> is considered to be a bycatch of some 100 finfish netting vessels. Irish <em>P. elephas</em> exports fluctuated from a high of 271 t in 1959 declining to current landings of around 20 t by 30 boats (Tully 2011). &#160;Portuguese stocks (mainly along the southwest coast) are also overfished with consistent declines in abundance and present landings down to 10% of those in the late 1980s and 1990s (Galhardo <em>et al</em>. 2006); annual official landings in 2006-2007 amounted to 12 t (Barrento <em>et al</em>. 2008). &#160;In combination, and despite under-reporting, the trends shown above reflect strong declines of lobster stocks in the Atlantic, where some fisheries are commercially extinct, although returning in some areas (i.e. Ireland), but also in the Mediterranean where viable fisheries operate. The cause appears to be primarily fishing mortality.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species&#160;is distributed in the Eastern Atlantic from Norway to Morocco and throughout the Mediterranean, except in the extreme eastern and south-eastern regions (Holthuis 1991). It is also present in the Canary Islands (R.

Closed seasons, where in force, appear to be the most effective management measure for the species.&#160; There are several marine protected areas that are closed or limit lobster fishing within their boundaries in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, although most of them are small.&#160; The exception is the MPA of Columbretes Islands, a 23-year old, no-take area of 55 km<sup>2</sup> off eastern Spain, where <em>P. elephas</em> has reached biomass levels 14 times higher than in fished areas, regional reproductive potential has increased by six (Diaz <em>et al</em>. 2010) and an annual net contribution of spillover from the MPA to local fishery yields of 13% has been estimated (Goñi <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2010).</p>  <p>Information is needed on catches and effort in the major fisheries and how these have changed with time. Monitoring of CPUE data across all fisheries associated with this species is essential to determine the level of impact harvesting is having on local populations, as well as the species as a whole.

These two subpopulations are situated 16 km apart, separated by the Aegean Sea (Olivier and Coutsis 1995). The butterfly thus has a very restricted range with a total extent of occurrence (EOO) of less than 700 km<sup>2</sup> (approximately 600 km<sup>2</sup> in Turkey) and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 498 km<sup>2</sup> (456 km<sup>2</sup> in Turkey and 42 km<sup>2</sup> in Greece). The European Red List of Butterflies lists the subpopulation in Greece as Near Threatened because of the species’ extremely restricted range in Europe (only one location) and lack of specific threats (van Swaay <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The subpopulation in Turkey is located on the Bodrum peninsula, a popular centre for tourism. The major threat here is ongoing tourism-related building developments, as local urban development plans ignore the need to conserve this species and its habitat. Also, despite the fact that there is no threat associated with the site in Greece, if there is gene flow between the Greek and Turkish subpopulations, a decline in Turkey would be expected to have a negative influence on the Greek subpopulation. The species is therefore listed as Endangered (EN B1ab(iii) + 2ab(iii)).","In Turkey, the butterfly occurs at low altitude (0-100 m asl), in moist and shaded grassy places in the close vicinity of bushes and trees.&#160;They have a rapid flight.&#160;The flight period is from early May to early June, then after aestivation until August (Hesselbarth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1995). However, on Nisyros in 1987 G. Thomson found fresh males and females right up to the 17th July, even when it had been very hot for some time. Whether this was an early break from aestivation or a normal pattern of behaviour is not known, but it was notably different from Eastern Meadow Brown which was aestivating at that time (but could be disturbed from its hiding places). It therefore appears that the flight times of Halicarnas Brown are worth investigating and may have some bearing on its speciation.<br/><br/>In Greece the butterfly is recorded at low altitude throughout the island in dry, open scrub and near agricultural land (van Swaay <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009) and in the town. The larvae feed on grasses and the adults are often observed nectaring on oregano (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Origanum</span> spp.) (Hesselbarth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1995).&#160;This species is single-brooded.&#160;The eggs are laid on meadow-grasses (Poaceae) (Karaçetin and Welch 2011).","The Bodrum Peninsula has a warmer and drier climate than the rest of the Aegean Coast and is one of the most popular tourism centres in Turkey. The main threat to this butterfly is thus the spread of new houses and tourism facilities which are steadily reducing the amount and quality of natural habitat available. Since conservation of the butterfly and its habitat are not considered in urban development plans this situation can be expected to worsen&#160;(Karaçetin and Welch 2011).<br/><br/>The European Red List of Butterflies does not identify any specific threat for the Greek subpopulation (van Swaay <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). However, as this species has a small range in Greece (extent of occurrence of 40 km<sup>2</sup>) it is vulnerable to environmental change.","The range of Halicarnas Brown is very restricted. In Turkey, the records are from six adjacent 10 x 10 km squares which are all facing the same threat (expansion of settlements and general building developments, much of it related to tourism). The species is thus considered to exist at a single location in Turkey (Red List Working Group 2009). In Greece, the size of the population is small and very restricted and considered to comprise one location (van Swaay <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Thus, globally the species thus occurs at just two locations.",Unknown,"the Halicarnas Brown is recorded from Greece (Nisyros Island) and Turkey (Mugla province) (Kudrna 2002). In Turkey, where the larger subpopulation is located, it occurs only on the Bodrum Peninsula. However, experts consider it may also occur on other southwest coast peninsular areas but as yet there is no evidence to support this (G. Thomson pers. comm. 2010). The Greek and Turkish subpopulations are separated by about 16 km of the Aegean Sea (Hesselbarth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1995, Olivier and Coutsis 1995) and it is not known if they are connected.

3933275,134293,Potamon fluviatile,Near Threatened,,2008,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Despite the wide distribution of this species (E00 800,000 km²) and the relatively high number of localities and records, some of its populations (especially those on islands) are discontinuous and highly fragmented, and the threat level is high, so there is cause for concern for the future of some of its isolated subpopulations. Although the wide distribution and high number of records for this species might imply that it should be assessed as Least Concern, the balance of evidence indicates that populations of this species may nevertheless be under immediate and long-term threat from rapid anthropogenic changes affecting its habitat such as water diversion, drainage, habitat disturbance, over-harvesting, and pollution. This species is therefore assessed here as Near Threatened (NT) because it is possible that populations of <em>P. fluviatile</em> in parts of its range might be in danger of extirpation in the future, especially those on islands or near centres of human population on the mainland. It is considered to be close to qualifying for category A2 (possibly also A3 and A4) under population reduction, and may already be sufficient to qualify as VU but data are lacking.","This species is found in rivers, streams and lakes throughout its range. In the Northern Apennine mountains in Tuscany, Central Italy, <em>P. fluviatile</em> lives in streams that are part of the Arno and Reno river basins (ranging from 155 to 596 m a.s.l.) that flow through wooded areas over both calcareous and siliceous rocks (Nocita <em>et al</em>. 2006, Barbaresi <em>et al</em>. 2007). In streams and rivers crabs shelter under stones or among vegetation, or they rest in their burrows dug into the banks; burrows are up to 50 cm deep and have water at the bottom. Crabs are most active between May and October, after which (i.e., from November to February) they are less active and hibernate either in natural refuges or inside burrows (Gherardi <em>et al</em>. 1988, Gherardi <em>et al</em>. 1998). Crabs feed at night either in water or on land, and they are opportunists that consume a wide variety of food items, that is either dead or alive, plant of animal. Food items include vegetable matter, tadpoles, insects, small frogs, and fish. Crabs have few predators, but they are vulnerable to habitat degradation, over-harvesting, and pollution (despite the population of crabs in an unpolluted part of the city of Rome). Young crabs are more aquatic than adults, and females mate in late spring and release hatchlings in summer. Crabs are semi-terrestrial and spend time out of water either at night or in the day when it is raining. Crabs are capable of dispersal by walking on land across relatively short distances to reach nearby streams.","Many freshwater habitats in the Mediterranean region where <em>P. fluviatile</em> occurs (Italy, Greece and the Maltese Islands) are increasingly subjected to unprecedented levels of human disturbance, and the future rate of species extirpation in these habitats is predicted to be almost five times greater than that for terrestrial animals and three times that of coastal marine mammals (Ricciardi and Rasmussen 1999). For example, since 1900 Greece has lost an estimated 75% of its wetlands due mainly to human activities. Many populations of river crabs are now in urgent need protection, especially those populations that are found on the Mediterranean islands. <em>Potamon fluviatile</em> is associated with streams and rivers and it is important that these habitats be protected from pollution and drying out. Growth of agro-business (for fruits and agrarian products) and of tourism (hotels) have caused local water pollution and have placed large demands on the supply of fresh water. Also, increasing use of pesticides and insecticides on fields has caused increasing contamination of ground water, ponds, and streams. In some places stream beds have been concreted to make water channels and this has adversely affected crab populations by preventing them from digging burrows for shelter and breeding. An increasing volume of water is being extracted from streams and rivers in pipelines to supply hotels, factories, villages, industry and agriculture, and this is causing drying and a subsequent loss of aquatic habitat. <br/><br/>Interestingly, studies on <em>P. fluviatile</em> in Italy indicate that the main factors affecting its distribution are anthropogenic pressures and uncontrolled harvesting rather than specific alterations to the biotic and abiotic parameters of its aquatic habitat.<br/><br/>Studies in mainland Greece indicate that <em>P. fluviatile</em> may be threatened by pollution and habitat alterations. Populations of this species in the Axios River delta (along with the Aliakmon delta and Loudias and Gallikos rivers) live in a protected area that consists of wetlands of great ecological and international importance (Ramsar convention). However, even this habitat is now threatened by industrial pollution (from the disposal of industrial solids and liquid wastes from tanneries, slaughterhouses, pig farms, and phosphoric fertilizer factories), by sewage sludge, and by water extraction for irrigation and electric power production. Additional threats to crab habitat come from pesticides and herbicides, uncontrolled river sand extraction, alluvial deposits, overgrazing, overfishing, poaching, and arbitrary building.","Population levels of <em>Potamon fluviatile</em> have declined dramatically in recent years throughout its range. This trend towards a decline in population levels is often explained as the result of factors such as pollution, overharvesting, and habitat damage (Matthews and Reynolds 1995, Gherardi and Holdich 1999). More recently, the introduction of non-indigenous crayfish species into southern European waters may pose a further threat to freshwater crab survival (Gherardi and Holdich 1999). In the Maltese islands <em>P. fluviatile</em> has disappeared from a number of valleys either because its habitat has dried up, or because the springs that feed the water body have been polluted, or because it has been over-harvested by humans for food. In Greece, crabs used to be common in the Gallicos River system on the plain west of Thessaloniki, but none were found in surveys in the 1990s. This loss is attributed to the introduction of intensive agriculture here in the 1970s-1980s and to the increased use of insecticides, pesticides, and water draw-off for irrigation (Pretzmann 1993). Similarly, in 1978 the only living population of crabs on the island of Andros (Cyclades) was found near Meldano, and crabs were not found during searches elsewhere on the island where these animals.",Decreasing,"Potamon fluviatile has a highly fragmented geographic distribution over a wide area in a number of countries that have a Mediterranean coastline. This species is found in Italy (Trento, Lombardia, Veneto, Liguria, Toscana, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Puglia, Calabria, Sicily Provinces), the Maltese Islands (Malta and Gozo), the Balkan Peninsula (Croatia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania), and Greece (western mainland Greece plus the Ionian islands and western Aegean islands). In mainland Greece the Axios River in the Macedonian Province marks the easternmost point of its distribution. It is found in the Axios,Kalamas, Aheron, and Arachthos River drainages, and in Peloponnesos in the Pinios, Piros-Tethreas, Pamisos, and Evrota River drainages. The distribution of P. fluviatile also includes the provinces of Pella, Trikala, Larisa, Fthiotis, Prevenza, Aitolia-Akarnania in western Greece, and the Peloponnesian provinces of Korinthia, Arkadia, and Lakonia. Potamon fluviatile is also found on the Ionian islands (Kerkyra (=Corfu), Kefallinia, Lefkas, Zaknythos (=Zante)); on the Northern Sporades Islands: Skiathos and Skopelos islands (Magnesia Province), Evvoia island and Skyros island (Evvoia Province), and in the Cyclades island of Andros.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Current national and international conservation efforts aimed at preventing populations of freshwater crabs in the Mediterranean region from decline are generally inadequate due to a general lack of knowledge of crab ecology and biology, and to long-term neglect (until recently) driven by the low economic value of these animals. The distribution of <em>P. fluviatile</em> in the Southern Tuscan Apennines (and presumably in the rest of its range) is not obviously associated with any biotic or abiotic parameters (Vannini and Gherardi 1981, Barbaresi <em>et al</em>. 2007). For example, this species is not highly sensitive to environmental conditions and occurs in waters that have relatively high minimum and maximum temperatures, variable oxygen levels, a wide range of dissolved ions, and different bedrock types. In addition, high concentrations of calcium in their water does seem to affect crabs, presumably because calcium is an essential element for crustacean exoskeletons. Informal field observations of river crabs in urban areas indicate that <em>P. fluviatile</em> may be quite resistant to some kinds of water pollution.<br/><br/>Leaf litter is a common component of the diet of crabs but it is not the sole source of protein for these animals (Gherardi <em>et al</em>. 1987). Shelters and burrows in streams are vital for survival because adult crabs seek refuge either in burrows or under riparian vegetation and juvenile crabs hide under pebbles and cobbles to avoid predation by fishes and adult conspecifics. The conservation of these freshwater crabs depends heavily on habitat protection and the preservation of freshwater ecosystems. Given the crisis that populations of native freshwater decapods are facing (Gherardi and Holdich 1999, Füreder <em>et al</em>. 2002) it is imperative that conservation planners make the most effective use of information currently available. The protection of river crabs needs to be strongly regulated at all levels of legislation (from community to regional levels) in order to guarantee the preservation of crabs throughout their distributional range. In Italy, <em>Potamon fluviatile</em> is protected by local regulations and regional laws but these have been adopted by only a few regions (Latium, Tuscany, Liguria, and Abruzzo), and are often not sufficient to preserve this species from decline. For example, crabs are not found in every part of suitable habitats within their range. The presence of crabs in some streams and their absence in similar streams nearby may be the result of over-exploitation by fishermen who continue to poach crabs despite the protection of crabs by local laws, an explanation that is supported by reports from local people and by long-term researchers. Today the pressure on freshwater resources ranges from moderate to intense, and some species have either been reduced or even locally extirpated from parts of their range. There is at present very little effective management and conservation in many parts of the distributional range of this species. Existing plans for managing aquatic inland resources primarily focus on water use and do not include specific, enforceable monitoring and management objectives, conservation actions, and little being done to <br/>protect either aquatic habitats and communities or endangered and threatened species.<br/><br/><strong>Recommendations</strong>. Rivers and streams should be protected against drying. Perennial rivers, and those rivers that normally flow for only part of the year, should be protected against extended seasonal drought because these are vital habitats for aquatic freshwater animals. Stream and river beds should not be concreted to make channels and water pollution should be prevented. Water pollution should be prevented, and the collection of crabs for food should either be banned or regulated.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Mediterranean

Although the wide distribution and high number of records for this species might imply that it should be assessed as Least Concern, the balance of evidence indicates that populations of this species may nevertheless be under immediate and long-term threat from rapid anthropogenic changes affecting its habitat such as water diversion, drainage, habitat disturbance, over-harvesting, and pollution. This species is therefore assessed here as Near Threatened (NT) because it is possible that populations of <em>P. rhodium</em> in parts of its range might be in danger of extirpation in the future, especially those on islands in the eastern Aegean or near centres of human population on the mainland in southwestern Turkey. Therefore it may be close to qualifying as Vulnerable under A2.","<em>Potion rhodium</em> has been collected from springs, a well basin at a spring in a cypress forest, in the streams and rivers in western Anatolia in Turkey, and in freshwater habitats on the islands of Rhodes, Ikaria, Tilos, Kos, and Samos. Otherwise there is no information on the habitat requirements of this species.","The major and future threats to this species include human induced habitat loss/degradation due to population increases and industrial and agrarian development. In Greece population declines and even local extinctions of P. rhodium relate to habitat destruction by human activities including water supply projects that adversely affect streams and rivers, and water pollution. Stream desiccation resulting from water abstraction for crop irrigation and the diversion of rivers and streams for potable water supplies for cities and towns represent other present and future threats to this species.","There is not much information on the population size and abundance of <em>P.rhodium</em> in most parts of its range, but it would appear that populations of this species on the islands of Rhodes may be declining. In 1935 freshwater crabs were reported to occur at Monolithos in Rhodes, but subsequent surveys of this area in 1963 and 1969 did not produce any specimens (probably because the spring that fed this aquatic ecosystem now leads directly into a pipeline, and the stream bed is now completely dry).

Therefore it may be close to qualifying as Vulnerable under A2.","On the island of Cyprus, this species inhabits streams and rivers up to altitudes where the water temperature does not get below 5°C, but it is absent from estuaries due to the relatively high salinities (brackish water) and pollution. Crabs survive temporary drying up events by hiding in deep burrows and under stones on river-beds and are also found in artificial ponds, but do not breed in stagnant water. Crabs feed on land at night and during the day when it rains, and can survive without any water for a long time in humid air. This species eats a variety of foods including detritus, green filamentous algae, fallen leaves, worms, amphipods, insect larvae, molluscs,  tadpoles, frogs, fish and carrion and will eat any plant or animal food. Copulation and spawning take place during the warm season from June until October. For the first 5-7 days hatchlings live under the female abdomen, where they grow up to carapace widths of 3.6 mm, after which they adopt an independent life mode.","In the Ukraine this species is threatened by habitat destruction resulting from water supply projects such as river-bed straightening and the building of reservoirs. In addition habitats may dry up due to the withdrawal of water for local needs, and crabs may be adversely affected by water pollution from non-purified sewage. Sometimes crabs are caught for food or for the aquarium trade. In Greece population declines and even local extinctions of <em>P. ibericum</em> relate to habitat destruction by human activities including dam construction and operation, stream channelization, canalization, and pollution. Another major threat is stream desiccation resulting from water abstraction for crop irrigation and the diversion of rivers and streams (e.g. the Evinos and Mornos Rivers) for potable water supplies for Athens and other cities and towns. Most development in Greece is occurring at lower elevations and this is affecting the small to medium sized streams near coastal areas where Potamon populations are most prevalent.","There is relatively little known about the population size or abundance of this species in most parts of tits range, despite the wide distribution and high number of records from over 10 countries. However, in the Crimea (Ukraine) there has been a distinct decline in population abundance and distribution of this species since the mid 1970s, and in some places populations of crabs may have already disappeared, and in others they may now be threatened. This has led to the authorities in the Ukraine to assess this species as Endangered in that country. Sharp population declines in other parts of the range of <em>P. ibericum</em> also give cause for concern, especially those that are isolated on islands. On the island of Chios in Greece, industrial pollution near Kalimasis (Kallimasia) has rendered stream water visibly dirty and no crabs were found living there in 1988 (Pretzmann 1993). Elsewhere in the southwest of Chios, rivers shown as perennial on maps have actually dried out and either have very little natural running water or are actually completely dry. A one-week search for freshwater crabs on Chios in 1988 found only a single population of crabs living in a small stream about 100 m long in the north of the island near Hagos (Pretzmann 1993). Similarly, on the Greek island of Lesbos, a population of freshwater crabs previously found in a small stream near Agra may be threatened or extirpated because this stream was reported to be in danger of drying out in the 1980s. On the other hand, <em>Potamon ibericum</em> has accidentally been introduced in southern France, and is apparently thriving there.",Decreasing,"This species has a wide and highly fragmented distribution ranging from the the middle and lower Danube River system and its tributaries and other coastal rivers of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, to the rivers of the Caucasus, northern Greece, and the northern Aegean islands. In the Black Sea region this species is found in Bulgaria (Haskovo, Varna, Burgas, Lovec, and Plovdiv Provinces), Ukraine, Crimea, Caucasia (= Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). This species is also found in the region to the south of the Caspian Sea region in Turkmenistan (Maurakis et al., 2004) and Iran (Mazandaran, Province).

The only stable population of crabs found was at Engares in the eastern part of Naxos. In Cyprus, freshwater crabs are locally abundant in the numerous year-round small springs and seepages in the Akamas peninsula, and in the mountain streams of the Troodos mountains and Paphos Forest. However, freshwater crabs have disappeared from many parts of Cyprus probably as a result of the extensive use of DDT and other insecticides during the campaign against malaria.

This species has very poor dispersal capacity (it is a weak flier), and consequently linear habitat features (e.g. avenues of ancient trees) are critically important for retaining connectivity and viable populations. The larvae develop in accumulations of wood mould in hollow living trees,
usually trunks and main boughs with large cavities containing large volumes of
wood mould, primarily derived from natural fungal decay of the dead heartwood.
Larvae normally take two years to develop, longer where conditions not optimal. Suitable trees may occur in a wide
variety of situations where trees have been retained into maturity and
old age, for a variety of reasons. (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009). In Hungary the strongest populations are in very old willow galleries; others are in mature oak forests (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Romania, in the southern Carpathians, it occurs in clear oak and beech forests from sun exposed slopes where large trees with big hollows occur.

The main overall threat is likely to be degradation or loss
of habitat quality, involving structural changes in the tree populations arising
from changing land use – affecting age structures and tree density.
Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging
can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a
result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often
exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of
beetle populations are also key factors. In particular, in Hungary, very old trees are threatened all over the country; the known
localities are threatened by over-collecting and destroying
microhabitats (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009).</p>","<p>There is little information

This includes stones, logs, roots and aquatic and marginal vegetation. This species prefers soft bottoms with some sand and is not usually found in water bodies with a muddy substrate. In addition, it prefers soft banks where it constructs simple burrows. The oxygen demands of this species can be quite high, leading to high mortality in shallow, eutrophic ponds during summer months (Souty-Grosset <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006).

The Signal Crayfish have also been shown to have a relatively higher population growth time than the Noble Crayfish.

Notable declines are reported for most of the other countries, other than Belarus where numbers are said to be increasing; Croatia where numbers are stable but non-native species have recently been introduced so future declines are expected; &#160;Slovakia where numbers are thought to be stable. These figures indicate that this species is likely undergoing a rate of decline of around 50-80% over a 22.5 year period. However, there are a number of large-scale re-stocking programs for this species and in some areas of its range, numbers are stable so the true rate of decline is likely closer to 30-50% globally.<br/></p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>","<p>Natural subpopulations of the Noble Crayfish have been declining across Europe since the introduction of crayfish plague in the mid nineteenth century (Holdich 2002).&#160; This species used to be the main target of crayfish trapping in Europe, but this industry is now much reduced in central, eastern and southern Europe (Ackefors and Lindqvist 1994).

Declines in the population numbers and range of this species have been noted (Skurdal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999). However attempts are being made to reintroduce this species into former areas of its range through translocations and hatchery reared juveniles (Skurdal<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 1999). <br/></p>  <p><span style=""background-color: red;""><span style=""background-color: red;""><span style=""background-color: red;""><span style=""background-color: white;"">Finland: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Astacus astacus</span> population is at a very low level compared to historical (pre-1900) levels. The current rate of the decline of the separate <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. astacus</span> populations is low (probably less than 5 % per 20 years), but the decline of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. astacus</span> population size in the whole country is continually declining 20 % or even more every 20 years (M. Pursiainen pers. comm. 2010).<br/></span></span></p>  <p>France: This species is said to be close to extinction in Lorraine and Morvan, however restocking has been attempted. It is also present within other regions of France, including Alsace. In south and southwestern France it has been extending its range, it is an introduced species (Y. Machino pers. comm. 2009).</p>  <p>Georgia: There does not appear to be any recent accounts of this species within Georgia.</p>  <p>Germany: This species was once widespread and abundant throughout Germany, but over the last century it has become restricted to more upland regions due to habitat degradation, competition, predation and disease (Schulz 2000). In the district of Lower Saxony in northwest Germany, this species was reported from 155 sites in 1920 (after the introduction of crayfish plague), but by 1990 it was only present at 12 sites (Schulz 2000), a decline in range of 56% over a period of 22.5 years.</p>  <p>Greece: The distribution of the Noble Crayfish in Greece is now much more restricted and fragmented than in previous decades (Koutrakis <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>  <p>Hungary: The Noble Crayfish is the most widespread crayfish species within Hungary, and certainly the most common within northern regions (Puky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2005). Data from the commercial harvest of <em>A. astacus</em> indicate that there has been a decline in the abundance of approximately 95% over the last 22.5 years, from an annual catch of 13,000 kg for export in 1961 and only 1,000 kg in 1980 (Puky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). This species is still considered to be declining owing to habitat degradation and loss, and crayfish plague (Puky and Schád 2006).&#160;<span style=""background-color: red;""></span></p>  <p>Latvia: There are little available data on the current status of the population within Latvia. It is known to be widespread (T. Taugbøl pers. comm. cited in Holdich 2002).</p>  <p>Lithuania: In 2008, a study to look at sites from which this species was previously known found this species at three of six rivers (only one of these three rivers in fact had an abundant populations, while the others contained <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Orconectes limosus</span>). Out of 14 lakes that were looked at, only nine contained this species (seven lakes were estimated as having quite abundant populations) and five lakes were devoid of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Astacus </span>(though two of these have been reported to contain crayfish by local people). The conclusion is, despite healthy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. astacus</span> populations still being present, there is a decline in the abundance of this species as a result of the invasive species <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Orconectes limosus</span> (K. Arbaciauskas pers. comm. 2010). </p><p>Macedonia: This species is known from the Vardar drainage system as well as from the Ohrid Lake - Drin drainage system (Y. Machino pers. comm. 2009). Within Lake Ohrid this species is showing a steep decline in population numbers possibly as a result of pollution (Y. Machino pers. comm. 2009). <em>Austropotamobius torrentium</em> is already thought to have gone extinct in a tributary of Lake Ohrid (Koselska Brook) below Reica as a result of pollution (Y. Machino pers. comm. 2009).&#160;</p>  <p>Moldova: There are no available data on the current population trends for this species within Moldova.</p>  <p>Montenegro: It is the opinion of Y. Machino that  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Astacus astacus </span>is native in the  Danubian drainage. Then on the  Mediterranean side, it is exotic, and&#160;people have introduced with success.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Netherlands: This species is indigenous to the Netherlands, however it is thought to be close to extinction. Surveys of this species presence/absence in rivers and brooks throughout the Netherlands, indicate a rapid decline with it being known from a single river in 2001 (Niewold 2002). Prior to 1920 it was known from 44 localities, 1921 - 1940 = 32 localities, 1941 - 1960 = 28 localities, 1961 - 1980 = 15 localities, 1981 - 2000 = 4 localities, and in 2001 = one locality (Niewold 2002). Over the last 22.5 years this equates to a decline of ~86%.</p>  <p>Norway: The Noble Crayfish, the only crayfish species in Norway, has undergone significant declines since the introduction of crayfish plague in the late 1970s to the Glomma, Halden, Veksa and Store Le watercourses (Taugbøl 2004). Since the late 1980s there have been reintroductions of crayfish adults and juveniles into both the Glomma and Halden watercourses. These subpopulations are developing at varying rates (site habitat characteristics are thought to be largely responsible) however population densities are still significantly below pre-plague densities (Taugbøl 2004). This species has also been reintroduced to the Veksa watercourse. This is believed to have been as a result of fishermen, however the population is much reduced compared to pre-plague densities (Taugbøl 2004). This is thought to be due to declining water quality conditions (Taugbøl 2004). This species is estimated to have undergone &#160;<strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">~61%</strong> decline over the last 22.5 years from a 40 tonnes yield in 1966, to 10 tonnes in 1999 (Skurdal <em>et al</em>. 1999).<span style=""background-color: red;""></span>   However, in Lake Steinsfjorden in south east Norway, CPUE (individuals per trap night) data indicates a recent increase in abundance, though there are no recent data for the period 2000 to present (1979 - 1.1; 1980 - 1.1; 1981 - 0.8; 1982 - 0.8; 1983 - 1.3; 1984 - 1.4; 1985 - 1.3; 1985 - 1.3; 1986 - 1.3; 1987 - 0.7; 1988 - 0.6; 1989 - 0.5; 1990 - 0.7; 1991 - 0.8; 1992 - 0.6; 1993 - 0.9; 1994 - 0.7; 1995 - 0.6; 1996 - 0.5; 1997 - 0.6; 1998 - 0.9; 1999 - 1.0; 2000 - 1.0). This lake is the most important crayfish locality in Norway and accounts for approximately 25% of the annual harvest (Taugbøl and Eriksen 1991, Skurdal,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>G  årnas and   Taugbøl 2002).<strong><strong><a name=""bcor1""></a></strong></strong></p><p>Poland: This species is widespread within Poland, but is in decline. Approximately one subpopulation is lost every two years (1998 - 98 subpopulations, 2008 - 89 subpopulations) as a result of the introduced species <em>Orconectes limosus</em> Spiny-cheek Crayfish. The range expansion of this introduced species is attributed to the growing tourism industry within Poland, and hence growing interest in angling. Anglers are said to be responsible for moving this species around as it is often taken for bait (P. Smietana pers. comm. 2009). Other possible reasons for these declines may also be due crayfish plague and pollution (P. Smietana pers. comm. 2009). Restocking of this species in former parts of its range is underway. New subpopulations are also still being discovered, although numbers are low. These subpopulations are thought two have always existed, but have only recently been discovered due to the expansion in survey area (P. Smietana pers. comm. 2009). The listing of Vulnerable in the Polish Red Data Book is thought to be suitable to the current situation (P. Smietana pers. comm. 2009). </p>  <p>Romania: This species is known from the Carpathian region and an area in the north east of Romania, however it is possible that it is in fact more widespread (L. Miron pers. comm. 2008). Moderate declines in this species have been observed in Romania (L. Miron pers. comm. 2008).</p>  <p>Russian Federation: This species is widespread within Russia, although it is declining in areas of its range. This species is known from Vologda district, Novgorod district, Kaliningrad district, Pskov district and Leningrad district (Fedotov, Bykadorova and Kholodkevich 1998). The population status is not known within Vologda district, however it is said to be found within most lakes and rivers. It is occasionally taken as by-catch by fishers, but is not sold in markets (Fedotov, Bykadorova and Kholodkevich 1998). Kaliningrad is a small district within Russia with a very high population density. The water bodies are said to be badly polluted (Fedotov, Bykadorova and Kholodkevich 1998). This species is now absent from a large number of the water bodies in which it was previously found. The Pskov district is said to have a lot of suitable habitat for this species and produces an annual catch of 10,980 kg (Perminov 1995).</p>  <p>Serbia: This species was once found all over Serbia but now is only known from a few very restricted localities (Simic <em>et al</em>. 2008, Y. Machino pers. comm. 2009).</p>  <p>Slovenia: This species is native to Slovenia and is found in the Danube River basin, however subpopulations in the northeast of the country have been introduced (Budhina 1989). </p>  <p>Slovakia: This species is thought to be the most abundant crayfish throughout Slovakia (P. Manko pers. comm. 2008). It occurs within eastern and northern Slovakia. Subpopulations are thought to be currently stable (P. Manko pers. comm. 2008).</p>  <p>Sweden: It is estimated that at the beginning of the 20th century, there were some 30,000 subpopulations of this species in Sweden alone (Bohman <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160; However, by 1960, only 50% of these remained (Bohman <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160; In 1994, just 1,724 subpopulations were recorded and numbers continued to decline to 1,597 subpopulations by 1997 and approximately 1,000 subpopulations in 2002 (Bohman <em>et al.</em> 2006). It is estimated that the current rate of crayfish plague outbreaks has increased by 90% (L. Edsman pers. comm. 2008). Over the last 22.5 years there has been an estimated decline of <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">~78%</strong> based on a decline from 1,724 known subpopulations in 1994, to 1,000 subpopulations in 2002 (Fiskeriverket and Naturvårdsverket 1998; Database of Crayfish Occurrences 2005). However, this country still has one of the largest capture fisheries (Souty-Grosset <em>et al.</em> 2006).   This species is now regarded as Critically Endangered in the new 2010 Red List of Swedish Species (It was Endangered in the red list from 2005). This is based on the heavy decline but also on the fact that the crayfish plague has increased 10 fold in the last few years and the disease has now spread to parts of the country that still had Noble Crayfish (the north and middle west parts of the country) and never had crayfish plague before. This is due to illegal introductions of the introduced plague carrying signal crayfish. The species is more or less gone from lakes and rivers in the south and middle east parts of the country where the best habitats are climate wise and the best possibilities for good noble crayfish populations (Edsman and   Schröder 2009,   Gärdenfors 2010).  </p>  <p>Switzerland: Within Switzerland this species is considered to be in a state of decline largely due to <em>Aphanomyces astaci</em> and is considered to be 'threatened' or 'endangered' by the Swiss National Legislation on Fisheries (D. Hefti pers. comm. 2008, Füreder &amp; Souty-Grosset 2005).&#160; </p>    <p></p>",Decreasing,"The Noble Crayfish<span style=""font-style: italic;"">, Astacus astacus</span>, is indigenous and widespread throughout Europe. This species range extends from Russia and the Ukraine in the east, to Finland, Sweden, Norway in the north, to Greece in the south, and the United Kingdom and France in the west. A few recently introduced subpopulations are found outside Europe, for example Morocco. The occurrence of this species within Andorra, Cyprus, the UK, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Morocco and possibly Montenegro and Italy, is via introductions from neighbouring countries.<br/><p></p>",<em>Astacus astacus</em> is commercially harvested as a food source in parts of its range.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<em>Astacus astacus</em> has been previously assessed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List Index of Threatened Species (Version 2.3 of the Categories and Criteria), and is listed as Critically Endangered on the 2010 Red List of Swedish Species. This species is currently listed on the Danish Red List as ""at risk from eradication due to crayfish plague"" (S. Berg pers. comm. 2009). This species is also listed under a number of directives including the EU Habitats Directive Appendix V, and directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. It therefore requires the designation of special areas of conservation for its protection. It is also listed under Appendix III of the Bern Convention. There has been wide-scale development of species action plans for <em>A. astacus</em>. At present, there is wide-scale re-stocking of this species into lakes from which it was formerly known. <br/><br/>The import of live crayfish into Sweden from abroad is now prohibited.  Restrictions on catch levels, gear-type use and minimum landing size exist in several countries (Taugbøl <em>et al.</em> 2004). Restocking in Sweden is taking place but is met with little success (L. Edsman pers. comm. 2010). Given the continuing population decline, several species protection programmes have been initiated (including re-stocking and re-introduction activities) in various parts of Austria (Füreder 2009).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Also its main host, <em>Colletes succinctus </em>has become rarer and heathlands, the most preferred biotope for this species, are very threatened across Europe.","<em>Epeolus cruciger</em> inhabits sandy open biotopes and very often heathlands.&#160;This is a kleptoparasitic species,&#160;in that it parasitises the nests of other bee species.&#160;It attacks nests of <em>Colletes succinctus</em>, a species bound to <em>Calluna vulgaris </em>as its main provision source (Scheuchl 2000, Amiet <em>et al.</em> 2007). Populations attacking nests of <em>Colletes marginatus </em>at different biotopes (open sandy sites and postindustrial sites) were classified as separate species <em>E. marginatus</em>, which was mentioned as synonym to <em>E. cruciger</em>. Recently, some authors have considered it as a separate species (M. Kuhlmann pers. comm. 2013). Information about <em>Colletes hederae </em>as a host of <em>E. cruciger </em>(Amiet <em>et al. </em>2007) is not trustworthy.<br/><br/>In addition, heathlands, the species most preferred biotope, are very threatened in the whole Europe.","The main threat affecting the species is the significant decrease in the abundance of the main host&#160;(<em>Colletes succinctus</em>)&#160;of the species in southern and especially central Europe. The disappearance of the host species is due to the loss of&#160;heathlands through succession as well as afforestation and conversion of sandy sites into farmland.&#160;Thus, the previously very common <em>Colletes succinctus </em>and quite common <em>Epeolus cruciger </em>have become much rarer, and even extinct in some places. In the Czech Republic, both species are considered Critically Endangered: <em>Colletes succinctus </em>is now only known from<em> </em>six localities; <em>E. cruciger </em>was recorded recently at two localities after 40 years' absence (P. Bogusch and Jakub Straka&#160; pers. comm. 2014).&#160;&#160;<br/>According to information from other researchers, the situation in Germany, Poland and Switzerland is similar.

This species has however specific ecological needs and habitat reduction or degradation and direct killing may threaten local populations that are usually not composed of large numbers of individuals. Local initiatives of conservation or education are in some cases suggested.,"In Northern regions of its global distribution <em>Mantis religiosa</em> usually reaches the adult stage in summer and overwinters as ootheca. In southern regions adults can be found almost in every month of the year, depending on the latitude. Oothecae can resist to very cold winters with ice and snow and the adults can tolerate high temperatures in semi-desert environments (Battiston <em>et al.</em> 2010). Adults are generalistic predators that can be found in wild areas as well as urban gardens and seem to tolerate a moderate urbanization of the landscape. It is however a thermophilic insect that prefers natural environments with open and unmanaged spaces with small and dry bushes and tall grass (Battiston &amp; Fontana 2010) with a high diversity of prey.","Threats to this species are not well known but habitat reduction (i.e. high urbanization, intensive agriculture etc.) or interferences to its life cycle (direct damage to oothecae or individuals) may locally  threaten this insect. From historical times, <em>Mantis religiosa</em> is still often wrongly considered as poisonous, dangerous to humans or negative for agriculture and often killed intentionally. In some rural areas with closed environments direct killing may represent a significant threat to this species. <em>Mantis religiosa</em> seems to be very adaptable to moderate levels of urbanization, but intensive use of the landscape (tilling, cattling, overbuilding, etc.) may locally threaten this species, compromising its natural resources. The use of pesticides in agrosystems may also threaten this species directly or indirectly by killing/contaminating its natural prey and should be investigated.","<em>Mantis religiosa </em>is one of the most common species of the order Mantodea, but it is not easy to observe in nature due to its cryptic behaviour and presence in small local subpopulations. In the Mediterranean area its density can vary from an average of 0.07 individuals per square meters (Northern Italy in: Battiston &amp; Fontana, 2010) to higher densites in warmer localities (up to 2 individuals per square meter in central Italy (Battiston, unpublished data)), but always linked to particular habitats and environmental conditions and often restricted to small areas like open valleys, xeric clearings or roadside verges.

46440146,13340340,Bombus cryptarum,Data Deficient,,2016,2014-08-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"In North America, recent analysis suggests that this species remains common throughout its range, and has increased in relative abundance (Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 2014). The average decline of 0% suggests a Least Concern category for this species in North America. Similarly, in Europe, the regional Red List profile for <em>B. cryptarum</em> lists this species as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large overall population and no major threats (Rasmont <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, due to the difficulty in recognizing this species, there is no useful information available on the population trends in this species (Rasmont <em>et al</em>. 2014). Additional research should be conducted to determine the population trends of this species in Europe, and the status of this species in Asia.<br/><br/>Based on the calculations and trends (see <em>Population</em> section), along with published reports of bumble bee decline and the assessors' best professional judgement, we recommend this species for the Data Deficient Red List category at this time.","In Europe, this species is found in a range of habitats, including town parks and gardens, moorland and heathland (Rasmont <em>et al</em>. 2014, Scriven <em>et al</em>. 2015). North of the 45th parallel, populations of this species typically live in the plains, mainly in Ericaceae dominated habitats; further south, it is a montane species. In Lithuania, it is recognized as being widely distributed but more abundant in the forest landscape, especially in forest bogs, and areas with <em>Calluna vulgaris</em> (Rasmont <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In North America, this species occurs in tundra/taiga habitats (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Nests occur underground, and males patrol in circuits in search of mates. Example food plants include <em>Epilobium</em>, <em>Melilotus</em>, <em>Potentilla</em>, and <em>Senecio</em> (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Bumble bees, as a whole, are eusocial insects that live in colonies composed of a queen, workers, and reproductives (males and new queens). Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length. Bumble bees are well-known to engage in “buzz pollination,” a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.","No specific threats have been identified as impacting this species in North America. Koch and Strange (2012) report&#160;<em>Nosema bombi</em>&#160;infections in this species (under the name&#160;<em>B. moderatus</em>) in Alaska, although the prevalence of the pathogen was not high (lower than that seen in<em>&#160;B. occidentalis</em>, and not significantly different from the prevalence levels seen in other co-occurring bees). This strain of&#160;<em>Nosema bombi</em>&#160;may well be a long-term native pathogen in that area, and for now there does not appear to be cause for concern, especially since&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;was the most abundant bumble bee in the study, despite having the highest prevalence of&#160;<em>N. bombi</em>&#160;(44% infected).<br/><br/>Generally, bumble bees (<em>Bombus&#160;</em>spp.) are threatened by a number of factors including habitat loss, pesticide use, pathogens from managed pollinators, competition with non-native bees, and climate change (reviewed in Goulson 2010, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2009, Williams and Osborne 2009, Fürst&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Cameron<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011a, Hatfield&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Rasmont <em>et al</em>. 2015). Reduced genetic diversity resulting from any of these threats can be particularly concerning for bumble bees, since their method of sex-determination can be disrupted by inbreeding, and since genetic diversity already tends to be low in this group due to the colonial life cycle (i.e., large numbers of bumble bees found locally may represent only one or a few queens) (<span class=""apple-converted-space"">Packer and Owen&#160;<a>2001</a><span class=""apple-converted-space"">, Zayed and Packer 2005,&#160;Goulson 2010, Hatfield&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, but see Cameron&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011a and Lozier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>In Europe, in light of the difficulty in differentiating this taxon from its sibling species, it is not currently possible to determine any direct threats to this species (Rasmont <em>et al. </em>2014).</span>","<em><strong>Europe</strong></em><br/>In Europe, due to the difficulties with species identification, there is no useful information available on the population trends in this species (Rasmont <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/><em><strong>Asia</strong></em><br/>Population trends in Asia are unknown. <br/><br/><em><strong>North America</strong></em><br/>In North America, <em>Bombus cryptarum</em> has expanded its range southward in recent years. In 1915, the southernmost record was probably Banff, Alberta; by 1987 it had arrived in Kananaskis Country, about 40 km southeast of Banff; and by 2010 it had spread an additional 80 km east to become one of the more common bumble bees in Calgary, where it had never been previously recorded (Owen <em>et al</em>. 2012). This represents a rate of spread over the last 20 years of about 4 km/year. The simplest hypothesis that can account for this change is that it is just a continuation of the natural expansion of its range since the end of the last ice age. An alternative hypothesis is that it is filling the niche vacated as a result of the decline in another species, <em>Bombus occidentalis</em>. It is also increasing in abundance in the Kananaskis region of Alberta (Owen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Hatfield <em>et al</em>. (2014) evaluated this species’ North American spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the extent of occurrence (EOO) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 2014). This analysis also assessed changes in the species’ relative abundance, considered to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012). For all three calculations the database was divided into historical (1805-2001, N=128,572) and current (2002-2012, N=74,682) records. This timeframe was chosen to meet the IUCN criteria stipulation that species decline must have been observed over the longer of three generations or 10 years. Average decline for this species was calculated by averaging the change in abundance, persistence, and EOO. These measures of change between the recent and historic time periods were used to estimate the population trend that has occurred in the past 10 years, and to inform the application of an IUCN category. This analysis yielded the following results (see also Figures 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Information):<br/><br/><ul><li>Current range size relative to historic range: 28.94%</li><li>Persistence in current range relative to historic occupancy: 268.16%</li><li>Current relative abundance relative to historic values: 71.87%</li><li>Average decline: 0.00%</li><li>IUCN Category for the North American portion of its range: Least Concern; LC</li></ul><p></p>",Unknown,"<em>Bombus cryptarum</em>&#160;is a widely distributed species whose global range includes North America, Europe, and Asia (Williams<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014, 2012, Rasmont<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014, An <em>et al</em>. 2014).

However, it  could be locally threatened when trophic resources are reduced  (reduction of grazing by sheep and cattle) and when there are land use  changes.","<p>This is one of the greatest decomposers in the Mediterranean regions because of its size and biomass (Galante <em>et al.</em> 1995).&#160;</p>  <p>In southern France<em>&#160;</em>it&#160;is  principally found at low altitudes, below 250 m asl and rarely  exceeding 500 m asl. Exceptionally it has reached an altitude of 850 m  asl in warm and sunny places in the Eastern Pyrenees (Lumaret 1990).  This species is active from February to December (especially from April  to June and October to November), with a decreased activity during the  driest periods of summer. Oviposition occurs at the end of April to late  June. It&#160;inhabits diverse environments, from very open to degraded  scrubland (open garrigues), mainly on clay, loamy and sandy soils. This  species exploits preferentially cow and sheep dung, human excrement, but  also horse manure and boar feces (Lumaret 1990). <br/><br/>In Alicante  province (Spain), it&#160;is widely distributed. It is found from sea level  to over 1000 m asl, although it has a predilection for relatively lower  elevations (Lumaret 1978). The most established subpopulations are found  in open scrub and grassland, where they exploit sheep and cattle dung  (Verdú 1998). This species has two main peaks of activity in the year  (April and October). In the Sierras Alcoy, the activity continues until  July and August; in the Sierra Dianic, the xerothermic conditions extend  the activity period until autumn, coinciding with the maximum rainfall  period. The oviposition begins in April and lasts until June, as is the  case in France (Verdú 1998). In the Cantabrian mountains, it&#160;is found  from 250 to 1,150 m asl, with activity from June to November (Galante  and Rodríguez-Menéndez 1989). In the centre of Spain (Cabañeros National  Park), the species is active from spring to autumn, being more abundant  in grasslands and forests than in shrublands (Numa 2011). In southern  Spain (Doñana National Park), it&#160;exploits a wide variety of excrement:  cattle dung pats, human excrement,  horse droppings and fallow deer  pellets (Martín-Piera and Lobo 1996).&#160;</p>  <p>In Morocco, it&#160;is active  in spring and autumn (Romero Samper 2008). Janati-Idrissi (2000)  observed the same demographic peaks in the Middle Atlas, with the  highest abundance in spring. In the region of Fès-Sais, Fatima (1995)  only observed activity in spring. In Ifrane, Mohammed (1995) recorded a  higher number of individuals in spring than in fall. In eastern Morocco,  it is&#160;only present in February (Kadiri 1989). It has&#160;mostly been found  in grassland areas and eventually in forested areas. Its altitudinal  ranges is between 250 m asl (Karia, Janati-Idrissi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999) and 1,900 m asl. It is very abundant between 1,000 m asl (Ain-Leuh) and 1,900 m asl (Mischliffen; Romero-Samper 2008).&#160;</p>  <p>In Italy (Parco di Veio), it has been&#160;found all year round (Carpaneto and Mazziotta 2008).&#160;</p>  <p>In western Turkey, the altitudinal distribution ranges from<span lang=""EN-US""> 600 to 900 m asl near Dagmarmara, Manisa province (Anlas <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","There is no specific information available on threats affecting this  species. As for dung beetles in general, this species is affected by  changes in land use, such as changes in the type of livestock or  replacement of livestock for intensive agriculture, which could result  in local reductions. There is a potential risk of mortality of larvae  when breeding adults use dung contaminated with some veterinary medical  products (Lumaret <em>et al.</em> 1993, Hutton and Giller 2003, Lobo<em> et al.</em>  2006). In the Pineto Regional Park  (Rome, Italy), the scarcity of  grazing animals and the consequent food shortage for dung beetles caused  a decline of subpopulations&#160;and potentially its local extinction  (Carpaneto <em>et al.</em> 2005).","<p>The species is relatively abundant in southern France and Spain (Lumaret  1990, Verdú 1998).

As shiny cars are used by mistake for oviposition, large parking lots are often frequented.","There are no significant threats presently affecting this species.

This species has a broad geographic range and is common in areas of suitable habitat. Despite commercial exploitation of this species for food, the global annual catch of this species has shown a steady increase over the last 30 years.","This species is found within the continental shelf to depths of 150 m, though is more commonly found at depths above 50 m (Holthuis 1991). It is typically found on rocky substrates, but may also burrow into cohesive mud or form depressions in sand (Cobb and Castro 2006). This species uses rocky reefs for shelter, especially during moulting. It is a nocturnal species which feeds on mussels, hermit crabs and polychaetes. The European Lobster will not typically mature before 5-8 years; although like many other lobster species, this is largely dependent on water temperature (Prodöhl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007).<br/><br/>Spawning usually occurs during the summer months and eggs are carried for 9-12 months.&#160; Planktonic larvae may be dispersed widely over a development time of 5-10 weeks, while adult lobsters typically move over relatively short distances (M. Bell pers. comm. 2010).","<p>The greatest threat is the commercial scale exploitation of this species as a human food source. This species is harvested throughout its range, but the main fisheries occur around the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and the Channel Islands (Cobb and Castro 2006). This species was once taken in greater quantities in both Norway and Turkey, but significant declines in population size in the 1960s and 1970s have reduced the annual catch to a fraction of what it was formerly (FAO 2009). However, since the 1980s global landings of this species have been steadily increasing (FAO 2009).<br/></p>","This is an abundant species that is harvested in commercial quantities in parts of its range. The main fishing grounds are now the United Kingdom, Ireland, Channel Islands and France (Cobbs and Castro 2006). Landings were relatively steady until 1963 when they peaked at 4,800 tonnes and then dropped to around 2,300 tonnes. In the 1970s, landings fell further to around 1,800-1,900 tonnes but started to show signs of recovery in the early 1980s when they fluctuated between 2-3,000 tonnes. In 2006, 2007, 2008 landings were at around 4,300 tonnes (FISHSTAT Plus 2000).",Stable,"This species has a broad, geographic range across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. In the northern part of its range it can be found from the Lofoten Islands in Norway, to the southeast of Sweden and Denmark, though cannot be found in the Baltic Sea. Its range then extends along coastal mainland Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, south to the coast of Morocco.

A number of countries have imposed national minimum legal size limits, closed fishing seasons, and have prohibited the collecting of berried females. In an effort to protect lobster spawning potential in some areas, berried females caught may be V-notched on the tail before being returned to the sea.&#160; Under local by-laws or voluntary bans, such lobsters may not be landed until the V-notch has grown out (M. Bell. pers. comm. 2010). As of January 2002 an EU wide minimum legal size of 87 mm (CL) was imposed (Cobb and Castro 2006). This species occurs in a number of marine protected areas.<br/><br/>Aquaculture production of lobsters is a small industry at present, but there is a growing interest in its potential for areas where there have been significant population declines. There are 3 types of aquaculture practice: product enhancement, resource enhancement and full grow out. Product enhancement removes undersized wild individuals and then maintains them in culture facilities where they are fed until they reach a marketable size. Resource enhancement or stock enhancement has been practised for the last century, especially within north american and european fisheries. Local fisheries are regularly stocked with hatchery reared individuals. This practise was developed at a time when there was some concern that the wild fisheries would not be able to keep with the rate at which wild stocks were being exploited.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is found in a wide variety of habitats which are not under pressure and are sometimes artificial. The species is rather tolerant to man-made habitats. It is therefore considered as being of Least Concern.,"<em>Aeshna cyanea</em> is mostly found in standing and running waters with a slow current. It has a clear preference for small and at least partly shaded waters. When it occurs at larger water bodies it shows a clear preference for those parts which are visually apart from the main part of the water, for instance isolated by some higher vegetation (reeds, etc). The species needs waters where at least parts of the bottom are free of emerging vegetation. These situations can be found in pools which are still in the early stages of succession or, more often, in pools where leaves from nearby trees and bushes cover a part of the bottom. It is often the only dragonfly to be present in small, largely shaded forest pools often with no substrate other than leaf litter and in this situation larvae can occur in very high densities. In Western and Central Europe, it is also one of the most common dragonflies at garden ponds. Larvae are able to resist weeks of desiccation.<br/><br/>Adult males are either wandering or territorial, depending on the habitat and population density (Kaiser 1974, 1984; Poethke 1988). Due to wandering and dispersion, and&#160;locally&#160;to territoriality and mutual exclusion, often only a small fraction of the actual adult population is seen at the waterside. For these reasons, many adults are found in forests where they often hunt low by the ground in the shade of trees or bushes and even search for females at water puddles on forest tracks.","The species is common in most of its range and occurs in habitats that are not threatened in any way, and even in man-made habitats. A future decrease in the south due to global change may be expected but is not presently documented.","The species is abundant over the middle European latitudes up to the Baltic States and western Ukraine. More to the east as well as in northern and southern Europe, the species is much more scattered.<br/>Although large populations are known, adults are generally seen as isolated non-territorial wandering individuals. During these long-distance patrol flights, they visit any kinds of habitat, searching for females, and are found as isolated individuals. In huge populations, the males become territorial and remain in a given locality, fighting to exclude their congeners (Kaiser 1974, 1984; Poethke 1988).<br/>Populations are stable over most of the species' range and are even increasing in Scotland and&#160;Fennoscandia. In southern Europe, there is a risk of decrease due to climate change, but this is presently not documented.",Increasing,"<em>Aeshna cyanea</em> has a western Palaearctic distribution and almost its whole range lies within Europe. It is most abundant in western and central Europe, where it can be met over any kind of habitats, but has its original habitats in small, often forested ponds. It does not occur in Ireland except in cases of vagrancy, and becomes rarer in the north of Great Britain. In Fennoscandia it is found in the southern third of Finland and Sweden and in the southernmost part of Norway. The species is presently expanding its range towards the north and is less rare in e.g. Scotland and South Fennoscandia &#160;than in the past. To the east it occurs up to the Ural and doesn't seem to penetrate in the West Siberian lowland. The species becomes scarcer to the south of Europe and is lacking from e.g. the main part of Greece and some Mediterranean islands (Sardinia, Crete, all Aegean islands, Cyprus). It is highly localized in northern Africa with only few sites in Algerian and Tunisian mountains. In the Balkans, it remains mainly confined to mountain areas. In the Ukraine, it is distributed mostly in the West, although recent findings originate from the&#160;Crimean&#160;highlands.

This is a widespread species that is found in commercial quantities throughout its range. It is commercially harvested as a food source throughout its range and while stocks are in decline in some parts of its range, stocks appear to be stable in the northern fisheries which constitute the greater proportion of the population.","The species spends much of its time inside burrows constructed in muddy substrates.&#160; Emergence behaviour varies with depth and is related to light levels and other external factors.&#160; Adults are opportunistic predators and scavengers feeding on a range of benthic invertebrates.&#160; Reproductive frequency depends on latitude, varying from annual cycles in the southern part of the range to biennial cycles in the northern part. Spawning occurs in late summer or early autumn and ovigerous females remain in their burrows until the eggs hatch in late winter or early spring.&#160; Larvae are planktonic and settle in muddy substrates after 3-7 weeks (M. Bell pers. comm. 2010). Although specimens can reach up to 24 cm in length, this species is normally found between 10-20 cm in size (Holthuis 1991). Age at first maturity is thought to be around 2-3 years (Froglia and Gramitto 1981, Orsi Relini <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1998).","The greatest threat to this species is the commercial scale harvest for human food across its range. The largest fishing grounds for this species occur in the North Sea, the West of Scotland and the Irish Sea. It is also taken in the Bay of Biscay, the Iberian coast, Moroccan coast, Western and Eastern Mediterranean, and the Adriatic but in much smaller quantities (Bell, Redant and Tuck 2006).<br/><br/>Levels of fishery exploitation vary widely between individual stocks (Bell, Redant and Tuck 2006). ICES assessments indicate that many of the stocks with a long history of exploitation in the North Sea, to the west of Scotland and in the Irish and Celtic Seas, are fully exploited in terms of yield per recruit, but stock levels are relatively stable and with no evidence of recruitment declines (ICES 2003, 2004). New fisheries have developed over recent years on some large offshore stocks in the North Sea (notably the Fladen Ground and Norwegian Deeps) and there appears to be scope for further increases in fishing pressure on these grounds. In contrast. there have been declines in stock abundance in some southern areas, including the Bay of Biscay and, particularly, Atlantic shelf edge grounds around the Iberian peninsula, but it is not clear that recruitment declines have resulted from overexploitation (M. Bell pers. comm. 2010).<br/><br/>Trawling is the primary method of fishing. Vulnerability to trawling is strongly related to burrow emergence behaviour, and in areas where much of the fishing occurs in winter (e.g. the Farn Deeps grounds) there is a lower fishing mortality of females owing to the non-emergence of ovigerous individuals. Small creel fisheries also occur, notably in sea lochs in the west of Scotland. This is considered a more sustainable method of fishing than trawling, although there are concerns that larger numbers of ovigerous females are taken in creels (M. Bell pers. comm. 2010).","This species is found in commercial quantities throughout much of its range. Landings of this species have steadily increased since the 1950s from around 10,000 tonnes, to around 50-70,000 tonnes in the 2000s (FAO 2010).",Stable,"This is a widely distributed species ranging from Iceland, the Faroes and Norway in the north of its range, to the Atlantic coast of Morocco in the south including the west and central region of the Mediterranean.

They feed inside a dark-brown type of rotten wood, usually with a high moisture content. Development takes place in the border zone between the decayed and the fresh wood at the sawn-off/broken branches and around cavities (Malmqvist and Franc 2014). Pupation occurs in the dead wood after two or three years of development. Adults are said to visit flowers and are attracted to fermenting substances. Taking into account that the generation length of this species is probably around two or three years, three generations are considered to be around eight to ten years.","In Sweden (and this is thought to be the same for populations elsewhere in Europe) this species&#160;has declined as a result of the reduction in complexity/diversity&#160;of the landscape (Malmqvist and Franc 2014), resulting in loss of old and veteran trees from otherwise suitable open forests, farmland and urbanised areas. This conversion has not only resulted in fewer suitable habitats, but also in longer distances between the remaining favourable stands of old trees.

The characters traditionally used to differentiate the Caucasian populations (previously identified as <em>Hierodula transcaucasica</em>) are variable and not usable for species identification. The presence and taxonomy of the populations in South East Asia also need to be verified and updated. In the volume accepted here, however, <em>Hierodula tenuidentata</em> is widely distributed, with a large extend of occurrence (EOO) of about 18,000,000 km<sup>2</sup>, moreover it is commonly encountered in human settlements, parks and gardens. It has been recently recorded as an expansion in the Balkan area, where the origin of population is doubtful, with some additional artificially introduced populations in Central Europe which are expanding there as an invasive species. For all these reasons this species is assessed as Least Concern but further studies on its taxonomy (especially Caucasian populations), ecology and distribution, in particular on its possible fragmentation, are strongly advised.","<em>Hierodula tenuidentata</em> is a generalist and a very adaptable mantis, able to live from&#160;broad-leaf evergreen subtropical forests to arid Central Asian bushes and even to urban parks, gardens and countryside fields, making it synantropic to an extent (E. Shcherbakov pers. obs., Bekuzin 1989, Battiston <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Adults are ambush predators, residing in canopy of trees and in bushes and feeding on large flying insects, both during the day and night time. Sometimes they have been recorded to feed also on small vertebrates (Battiston <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the optimum of its distribution adults may be encountered until November (Tashkent: Bekuzin 1989) or even December (Sochi: T. Oganeso&#160; pers. obs.).

However, the species is encountered quite commonly in parks and gardens in Crimea and the Northern Black Sea coast (E.

122600528,16249,Parnassius apollo,Least Concern,,2021,2020-03-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Parnassius apollo </em>has been assessed as&#160;Least Concern across its global range because it has a wide distribution with estimated declines of no more than 15% over the past ten years. However, the species has declined up to 30% across the European part of its distribution. It is also under threat from climate change and increased human disturbance, especially in lowland areas. It is likely that this species' extent of occurrence will decline in the future, given that the species occurs in very restricted areas especially on the periphery of its European range, where any local extirpations would lead to declines in extent of occurrence. Better monitoring is required in eastern parts of its range to better delineate its distribution and establish if population trends are also in decline or are overall stable.","<p>The Apollo occurs in mountainous areas on steep, sunny slopes with sparse vegetation. The butterflies visit thistles and other flowering plants. The female lays its eggs singly or in small groups on or near the foodplant stonecrop (<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2; text-align:-webkit-left;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing:0px"">Sedum</em>&#160;spp.). The eggs develop but the tiny caterpillar hibernates inside the eggshell or as newly hatched larva in its close vicinity. In spring it starts feeding on the buds of the foodplant. The caterpillars of later instars also eat the leaves. When it is time to pupate, the caterpillars look for a safe place between the stones, where they then spin a flimsy cocoon in which to change into a pupa (Nakonieczny&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). The Apollo has one generation a year (Collins and Morris 1985). Its habitats are as follows: alpine and subalpine grasslands (23%), dry calcareous grasslands and steppes (19%), inland cliffs and exposed rocks (11%), screes (9%), coniferous woodland (7%), and broad-leaved deciduous forests (7%) (van Swaay&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, 2014).</p>","There are a range of threats to this species, including climate change, habitat destruction, abandonment of traditional livestock husbandry causing overgrowing and succession of habitats to forests, and collection. Lowland populations, where the species is declining, suffer from fragmentation and isolation (Nakonieczny&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007), whereas large and strong populations are still found in the high parts of the Alps and other high mountain ranges. For example, the Mosel population in Germany (<em>P. a. vinningensis</em>)&#160;has declined dramatically in recent years, likely due to climate change in combination with a high traffic death toll (Pfeifer 2017).&#160;The population also seems to have low genetic variability (Habel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). In Turkey, where it is a high-altitude species, it may be affected by climate change, but there are no data available to assess this (E. Karaçetin&#160;<em>pers. obs</em>.). Climate change may be a threat more widely across southern populations, for example in Spain, altitudinal shifts due to climatic changes have been recorded over the past decades (e.g. Wilson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Although similar studies are missing elsewhere, southern populations in other countries are likely to face similar shifts.<br/><br/>Habitat encroachment and loss is often linked to infrastructure development and human disturbance. In Greece, this species is under threat from habitat destruction in mountainous areas due to construction of large windfarms and other projects like roads, pylons and electrical cables (Tzortzakaki 2019). In Turkey, high altitude pastures have been opened to tourism which resulted in hotels and houses to be built in similar habitats; however, overall it is likely that within Turkey, the species is still Least Concern (Karaçetin and Welch 2011, E. Karaçetin&#160;<em>pers. obs.</em>). In parts of its range, like the Sierra Nevada in Spain, there is also continued pressure on populations from tourism development (Tinaut&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>Since Apollo larvae need exposed areas where host plants grow and where they can bask in early spring for feeding, land abandonment which leads to overgrowing of habitats with transition to forests is one of the major problems for the species in many parts of its range (R. Verovnik&#160;<em>pers. obs.</em>). In other parts of its range, overgrazing may be a problem (e.g. in parts of Greece; Tzortzakaki 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>Finally, collection is likely to impact the species, which has been included on CITES Appendix II. While this may particularly impact subspecies occurring in small isolated populations, in other parts of its range (e.g. Turkey) pressures from collection are unlikely to be high enough to cause significant declines in populations (Karaçetin and Welch 2011, E. Karaçetin&#160;<em>pers. obs.</em>).<p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","Populations are often isolated, disjunct and local (Collins and Morris 1985), due to its restriction to (semi-) natural areas. This is because it is a glacial relict and was isolated during the interglacial period in open habitats of mountainous areas and in higher altitudes, especially in the southern part of its range (Todisco <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In eastern Europe, it is reportedly extinct in Belarus, Latvia and Czech Republic (Maes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019) and also&#160;in Ukraine (Nakonieczny <em>et al</em>. 2007). The species had also gone extinct in Poland but has subsequently been reintroduced from Slovakia (Witkowski <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). Strong declines in distribution or population size of more than 30% have been reported from Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The Mosel population in Germany (<em>P. a. vinningensis</em>), the northernmost population of the species in Central Europe, used to be one of the strongest populations in Germany during the past decades, but has declined dramatically in recent years; this is likely due to climate change in combination with a high traffic death toll (Pfeifer 2017). In other parts of Europe, a decline in distribution or population size of 6-30% has been reported from Bulgaria, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden (data provided by the national partners of Butterfly Conservation Europe, as used in van Swaay <em>et al. </em>2010). There has also been a reported decline of 10-30% from Greece (van Swaay <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010,<em>&#160;</em>2014).<br/><br/>While in the continental biogeographical region the species is declining, the distribution of the species in the alpine biogeographical region seems to be rather stable and sightings of the species are reported throughout. In Italy, populations occurring in the Alps show a stable trend while populations occurring in the Apennines are strongly declining (Bonelli <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;In Turkey, and many other parts of the species' eastern distribution, it is not monitored and so it is difficult to assess population trends. However, there was no evidence of decline in population or extent of occurrence in Turkey (Karaçetin and Welch 2011).<br/><br/>Although populations in the eastern part of the range may be comparatively secure, it is likely that with the impacts of climate change, the species is also undergoing some declines there. However, these declines would likely have to be quite substantial (between 10-20%) to ensure distribution-wide declines of above 20%; however, it is more likely that across the full range, the species is declining by no more than 15% over 10 years.",Decreasing,"This species has a wide Palearctic range (Turlin and Manil 2005, Tshikolovets 2011).

It occurs in Central Europe at 1,000-2,400 m asl; for example,&#160;in the Alps, it ranges from 800 m to 2,400 m and its altitudinal range is going up, probably as a consequence of climate change (S. Bonelli <em>pers. obs</em>.).&#160;In Scandinavia and Russia, where there are many lowland populations, it flies at much lower altitudes, even near the coast (Henriksen and Kreutzer 1982,&#160;Fred and Brommer 2003).&#160;The species range extends via Iran (West Azerbaijan Province; Tshikolovets&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014) east to the Tian-Shan and Siberia and Mongolia; it is also known from the northern Urals to Transcaucasia, Turkey and the Middle East (van Swaay&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;2014).

The butterflies can often be seen visiting red or purple flowers for the nectar they need. The foodplants are&#160;<em>Corydalis spp.</em>, that at the time of egg laying is not yet above ground. The abandonment of grasslands and pasturing has lead to a decrease in the larval habitat in the central and southern parts of the European range. The eggs are laid on its dried stems, on grass blades, or on other plants not too far from the foodplants, and the egg 'hibernates'. In spring, as soon as it has hatched, the small caterpillar starts its search for a suitable foodplant. When fully-grown, it pupates in a closely spun cocoon of fine threads, situated above the ground in the leaves of the foodplant. Unlike most other parnassiines, and most butterflies in general, <em>P. mnemosyne</em> has only four larval stages. It has one generation a year.

A future population and range decline is expected due to climate change and rapid habitat alteration due to water exploitation.

Since 1990, the nominal subspecies has been recorded from 79 localities in 100 independent locations, but some former populations are either now extinct due to water capture directly at springs or strongly altered due to forest fires and significant spring displacement downstream. Its present known area of occupancy (AOO) is 492 km². It remains fairly flourishing in the north and the south of the Peloponnese and Euboea (Evvia) island, although some populations have been reduced or have even disappeared in some localities due to increasing drought.<br/><br/>The species faces problems from erosion and conservation of springs  throughout its range, particularly after forest fires, which are  occurring more and more frequently in Greece.

The pedestrian and motorized pathways all over dunes lead to vegetation destruction and therefore enhanced weathering and erosion. The potential for dune recovery is dependent on the sediment supply in each area and on the intensity of human impact. Dune plants are especially sensitive to disturbance and are heavily affected by humans. Without dune plants, the integrity and preservation of a stable dune complex cannot exist.

Given the small AOO and EOO, the small number of locations and continuing decline in habitat extent and quality, this species is assessed as Endangered in Europe. In the EU27, the AOO is 4 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and the EOO around 80 km<sup>2</sup>, it is found at one location because it is only known from one locality in Prespa Lake, and the habitat extent and quality is declining.

Larvae are probably to be found in water with decaying vegetable material in wetlands, more specifically in shallow pools.

Hydropower is also projected to be a future threat to the lake ecosystem. Habitat decline can also be impacted in a less rapid and perceptible way by the effects of climate change, such as by drought, modification of the flora due to variation in temperatures, and speeding up other damaging processes such as eutrophication and the appearance of alien species (Janssen <em>et al. </em>2017).","<p>The population trend of this species is currently not known.

The presence of this ant indicates that the trunk is hollow and hence that there may be suitable habitat for larvae to grow. In Serbia, the specimen was found in a tree in a garden in Novi Sad, and the ant was also present in this tree. It is suspected that without the ant, the hoverfly is unlikely to be found. It is important to highlight that the ant&#160;<em>Liometopum microcephalum</em>&#160;is also associated with aphid colonies. <em>Polistes dominulus</em> and the European ant hunter (<em>Tracheliodes curvitarsus</em>) could also be used to identify possible localities for this species (van Steenis <em>et al.</em> 2019).

It is found on all continents except Australia, most of South America, and Antarctica. This species is phytophagous and a habitat generalist. In Europe and the northern portions of North America, this species migrates from overwintering areas to the south each spring. Dramatic fluctuations in the number of migrants has been recorded, likely due to annual variation in climatic conditions. These fluctuations make population trends difficult to discern, but this species is reportedly common throughout its vast range. There are no specific threats recorded. Continued research and monitoring is necessary to ensure populations are stable. Due to the widespread nature of this species and the lack of specific threats, <em>V. cardui</em> is assessed as Least Concern. </a></p>","<p><em>Vanessa cardui</em> is not a habitat specialist and can be found in many habitats such as gardens, marshes, forests, meadows, fields, mountains and coastal areas (Opler and Wright 1999, van Swaay <em>et al. </em>2010). Spring breeding areas in Sonora and Baja California, Mexico, and California, U.S.A., which are used year after year, are typically semi-arid, desert, or chaparral habitats (Abbot 1951). Similarly, European spring migrants seem to originate from scattered sites in a narrow band of desert crossing from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula (Stefanescu <em>et al</em>. 2011). </p>  <p>Larvae of this species are phytophagous with more than 100 recorded host plants. However, plants in the families Asteraceae, such as Thistles (<em>Cirsium spp.</em>), Malvaceae, such as Mallows (<em>Malva spp</em>.) and Holyhawks (<em>Alcea spp</em>.), and Fabaceae, seem to be preferred (Opler and Wright 1999, van Swaay <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>  Flight seasons and voltinism varies for this species depending on regional climates (Opler and Wright 1999). In the Eastern Hemisphere, annual northward migrations take place from March to June, and the southern return migration takes place from September to November (Stefanescu<em> et al</em>. 2013). Around six generations are thought to take place in this time period. It is not entirely clear where most <em>V. cardui</em> are between December and February, although there is some evidence at least some individuals overwinter in tropical Africa, producing another generation or two (Talavera and Vila 2017).","There are no recorded threats specifically impacting this species across its range. However, due to its large distribution, it is likely that there are localized threats acting on smaller scales. Some butterfly species are evidently impacted by habitat conversion or degradation, agricultural intensification, and climate change (Flockhart <em>et al. </em>2015, Warren <em>et al. </em>2001, Forister <em>et al. </em>2010). Additional research is needed to ensure <em>Vanessa cardui </em>is not adversely impacted by such threats, especially as it experiences dramatic fluctuations in abundance and is migratory","<p>Little is known about the total population size of this species. Based on the extent of its range, it likely has a large population size, with some estimating more than 1 million individuals globally (NatureServe 2020). </p>  <p>Dramatic fluctuations in abundance of individuals migrating to northern latitudes every summer, both in the Western and Eastern Hemispheres, have been recorded (Vandenbosch 2003, Pollard <em>et al</em>. 1998). These fluctuations are likely due to yearly climatic variations. In the Western Hemisphere, fluctuations have been linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices (Vandenbosch 2003). For example, there are some areas in Sonora and Baja California, Mexico and California, in the United States, where breeding occurs on a vast scale in the spring (Abbot 1951). In years of heavy rain, food resource availability increases, and migrations from these areas often happen by the billions (Vandenbosch 2003). Similarly, at sites monitored by the British Monitoring Scheme (Pollard and Yates 1993) there were twice as many <em>V. cardui</em> recorded migrating to Europe in 1996, than the total number recorded in 20 other years of monitoring (Pollard <em>et al</em>. 1998). Due to these fluctuations, the population trend for this species is difficult to detect.</p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Vanessa cardui</em> is the most widespread butterfly in the world (Brock 2008).

Although it is common throughout much of its range, population size estimates and trends are unknown. There are no specific threats recorded for this species, nor are there any specific conservation actions in place. Further research should be done across the range of this species, to ensure regional populations are stable and ample high-quality habitat remains to support the viability of this species. Due to the widespread nature of this species and the lack of specific threats, <em>V. atalanta</em> is assessed as Least Concern. </p>","<p><em>Vanessa atalanta</em> can be found in many open habitats including moist fields, marshes, city parks and gardens, and along streams (Opler and Wright 1999, van Swaay <em>et al</em>. 2010). In the summertime, in the southwest U.S., it retreats to higher elevation montane habitats, avoiding the warmer temperatures of the lowlands below (Brock 2008). Larval host plants include members of the family Urticaceae, such as Nettles (<em>Urtica spp</em>.) and Pellitory (<em>Parietaria spp.</em>) (Opler and Wright 1999).&#160;</p><p>Flight season and voltinism vary regionally for this species (Opler and Wright 1999). In the northern climes of the United States, the flight season is March to October, and there are generally two generations per year (Opler and Wright 1999). <em>V. atalanta</em> cannot survive freezing temperatures, so migrates south or to lower altitudes in the fall (Opler and Wright 1999). In Europe, migrants arrive to the Mediterranean region in October and early November when the availability of their local host plant, <em>Urtica dioica</em>, is at its peak (Cuadrado <em>et al</em>. 2017). They spend the winter breeding, and the next generation heads north after hatching in the early spring. By July and August, they are absent form their wintering grounds (Cuadrado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Due to warmer temperatures in Europe over the last few decades, the timing of this spring migration is becoming earlier, with some individuals overwintering and breeding as far north as the UK (Fox and Dennis 2010). Similarly, in California, seasonal timing to adulthood has advanced by an average of almost 30 days, due to warmer temperatures (Forister and Shapiro 2003).</p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk17800425"">There are no known threats impacting this species across the entirety of its range. However, due to its large distribution, it is likely that there are localized threats acting on regional scales.

More research is needed to determine how these factors may impact <em>Vanessa atalanta</em> within its varied regional occurrences and habitats<em>.</em></p>","<p>Total population size for this species is unknown. It is reportedly common throughout most of its large range (Brock 2008), so it is likely to have a healthy population size. NatureServe (2020) estimates there could be as many as one million individuals globally.</p>  <p>Global population trend is also unknown, as studies have been carried out only at regional levels. One study from the UK reported increases in abundance over the last 40 years, likely due to warmer winters which have allowed increased reproductive success in Britain (Fox and Dennis 2010). Similarly, in Finland, larger numbers of <em>V. atalanta</em> butterflies were reported from 1991 to 2001, due to an increase in the number and scale of migratory events (<a name=""_Hlk36825227"">Saarinen <em>et al</em>. 2003</a>). On the other hand, one study from northeast Spain and Andorra suggests a moderate population decrease from 1994 to 2008, likely due to habitat changes (Stephanescu <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;Overall in Europe, some declines in distribution or population size have been reported from Malta, Spain and Ukraine (van Swaay <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Vanessa atalanta</em> is found throughout much of the Holarctic, where it is common and widespread (Opler and Wright 1999). &#160;</p><p>In the Nearctic, it occurs from south of the taiga to the highlands of Guatemala, although it is only a summer migrant throughout the northern portions of its range (Opler and Wright 1999).

However, the resident range of this species has expanded northward in recent years, due to increasingly warmer winters (Burton 2006, Fox and Dennis 2010). For example, <em>V. atalanta</em> is now commonly recorded throughout the winter months in Britain, where it has even been observed exhibiting courtship and breeding behaviours (Fox and Dennis 2010).

It is one of the longest living butterflies within this region, living up to 10 or 11 months. This species probably has a large total population size. There are no specific range-wide threats recorded for this species, although agricultural intensification appears to be driving localized declines in some regions, such as Ohio and California. While it is unlikely that declines are widespread, more research is needed to ensure global populations are stable. There are no conservation measures currently in place for this species, but it would probably benefit from decreased pesticide use in agricultural landscapes. Due to the widespread nature of this species and the lack of specific threats, <em>N. antiopa </em>is assessed as Least Concern. </p>","<p><em>Nymphalis antiopa </em>is one of the first butterflies to emerge at the beginning of the year because it overwinters as an adult (<span lang=""EN-US"">Opler and Wright 1999). Males are often seen perching in sunny openings, or on trees and shrubs, awaiting females with which to mate (Brock 2008). Adults are extraordinarily long lived, living up to 10 months (Brock 2008). Summer emerging adults feed throughout the summer and fall, diapause through the winter, and emerge again in the early spring to mate (Brock 2008). They have one generation per year (Shapiro 1986). </p>  <p><em>N. antiopa </em>is migratory in certain parts of its range, and therefore can be found in many habitat types including woodlands, openings created by parks and urban areas, and especially along riparian areas <span lang=""EN-US"">(Opler and Wright 1999, van Swaay <em>et al</em>. 2010). It rarely shows up in desert habitats (Brock 2008). Adults feed mostly on tree sap and rotting fruit, and only occasionally on flower nectar (ICE 2006). Caterpillars form aggregations and feed on Willows (<em>Salix spp.</em>), Elms&#160;(<em>Ulmus spp.</em>), Poplars (<em>Populus spp.</em>), Birch (<em>Betula spp.</em>) and Hackberry (<em>Celtis spp.</em>) (ICE 2006).</span></p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk16762189"">There are no recorded threats specifically impacting this species across the entirety of its range (e.g. van Swaay <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, due to its large distribution, it is likely that there are regional threats acting at smaller scales. For example, reported occurrence declines in Ohio from 1996 to 2016 may have been in part because of decreased quality of habitat and agricultural intensification, leading to increased pesticide use in corn and soybean crops (Wepprich <em>et al</em>. 2019). Similarly, declines in the Sacramento Valley of California were likely the result of increased use of neonicotinoids, starting in the mid 1990s, and habitat degradation (Forister <em>et al</em>. 2016). These factors are common drivers of change for butterfly populations, as is climate change (</a>Warren <em>et al.</em> 2001, Forister <em>et al.</em> 2010, Flockhart 2015). Understanding how these large scale threats impact <em>N. antiopa </em>is important to ensuring populations are stable range wide. </p>","<p>Little is known about the total population size for <em>Nymphalis antiopa</em>. As it is a widespread species, it likely has a large total population size.</p>  <p>While the overall population trend is unknown, there have been regional declines documented for some areas in recent years in North America (Forister <em>et al</em>. 2011, Wepprich <em>et al</em>. 2019). In one example, long term data revealed population declines across a 19 to 31 year period at four sites in the Sacramento Valley of California (Forister <em>et al</em>. 2011). In this study, presence/absence data collected biweekly at two sites from 1976 to 2007, and at another two sites from 1988 to 2007, revealed average declines of 4-11% per year (Forister <em>et al</em>. 2011). This equates to a 30-67% decline over a ten year period. In another example, a long-term study on the butterfly fauna of Ohio recorded a 34% decline in the occurrence of this species during surveys conducted between 1996 and 2016 (Wepprich <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p><p>In Europe, while the overall population trend was assessed as stable, declines in distribution or population size have been reported from Belgium, Romania, Turkey (European part), France, Germany, Latvia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland (van Swaay <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;</p>  <p>Declines as high as these are not recorded over the entire range of this species, and in some places populations have increased in recent years. In one study on butterfly abundance and diversity in Finland, <em>N. antiopa </em>increased in abundance from 1960 to 2003 (Kuussaari <em>et al.</em> 2005). Similarly, in northeast Spain and Andorra, this species’ numbers saw steep increases from 1994 to 2008 (Stefanescu <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>Clearly there is a need for increased monitoring of butterfly populations in all regions this species occupies, to ensure global population size is stable. </p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Nymphalis antiopa </em>is one of the most ubiquitous Holarctic butterfly species, ranging from the subarctic to the neotropics (Shapiro 1986).

Adults are crepuscular or nocturnal; in Central Europe they most frequently occur from late June to August. Life cycle length is probably two years (Burakowski <em>et al.&#160;</em>1987).","The general loss of old deciduous trees with hollows (Lindenmayer and Laurance 2016) and the decrease in volume of available dead or decaying wood in general are the greatest threats to this species. In managed forests, trees are cut down and removed from the habitat before any hollows can be formed or prior to the trees starting to&#160;decay. Consequently, during the last 100 years major changes have been observed in the preferred landscapes and habitats of this species. This initially forest-dwelling species, is nowadays also found in agricultural and even urban landscapes which might be generally unsuitable for it. Even in these habitats, a massive decline in the number of hollow trees takes place, since old trees are removed and cut down as they are no longer valued (for example, old avenues, pollarded trees), or are marked as ""dangerous"" to humans or property. In addition, many hollow trees found in historical pasture meadows, where grazing has now ceased, suffer from increased competition from younger trees. In most areas across Europe, the formation of new suitable trees occurs at a much slower rate than the deterioration of old trees. Consequently, an age gap is progressing and there may be no suitable habitat for the<em>&#160;</em>population in the future, which will result in several local extinctions of this species in Europe.

The distribution is uneven and with several gaps within the distribution area (which may be caused by lack of research or by lack of suitable habitat). For example, this species has not yet recorded from Lithuania (Tamutis <em>et al. </em>2011), although it is present in all adjacent areas. Novák and Pettersson (2008) omitted Belarussian&#160;(Alexandrovitch&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996) and Liechtenstein (Brandstetter and Kapp 1998) records for this species. In the northern parts of its distribution area most<em>&#160;</em>subpopulations are highly fragmented (as in Finland and Latvia). A record from SW Bulgaria is very recent (Sivilov 2015) as well as a record from continental Greece (Novák 2014) and these records have not been mentioned by earlier authors. The only Russian record is from the Kaliningrad exclave (Alekseev and Bukejs 2010), but the occurrence of this species in the extreme western parts of main Russia, near Latvian and Belarussian borders is projected.<br/><br/>Its current extent of occurrence (EOO) is <em>ca </em>4.6 million km² in Europe, and&#160;<em>ca </em>4 million km² in the EU 28.
